provided by the downloaded folder intact, i.e. do not change the names of the sub-folders 'test' and 'train'or the location of files inside the downloaded 
folder. The name of the downloaded folder itself may be changed according to personal preference (the R-script has to be adapted accordingly, see 
following steps).

`WorkingDir <- "/your_working_directory/"`
4. At the beginning of the R-script ('run_analysis.R') the directory (i.e. folder) wherein the downloaded data are stored has to be

`folderName <- "your_foldername"`
5. Run the R-script ('run_analysis.R') by copy-pasting its entire content into the R console at pressing enter. 
6. A text file containing the resulting data frame by the name of 'VariableMeans_ActivitySubject.txt' will appear in your working directory.
